# KiCad 3D models overlay

Extra 3D models extending the standard library.

## Notes

1. Not all of these comply with the KLC. Some on purpose, so no, I'll not be changing them all. But if you have individual suggestions I'll be happy to take a look.
2. These 3D are normally according to the part datasheet or images.
3. KiCad team: Feel free to move whichever models you like to the main repo.
